How to use:

1. Define a map with waypoints using (Google Maps)[https://maps.google.com/]
2. Open left side menu -> Share or embed map -> Copy link
3. Paste this link to (Google Maps to GPX converter)[https://mapstogpx.com/]
4. Rename to 'route.gpx' and paste the file to `public/` folder (overwrite)

Boom, the map data should be updated!

Code is very ugly but works ok

TODO v2:
- [ ] Live distance calculation & completion percentege
- [ ] Show enrite country when zoomed out
- [ ] Keep the sharp corner design
- [ ] Switch to light mode - dark map does not compress well when streaming
- [ ] More creative panning? Mabye like 5 variants - left, right, zoom in, zoom out, etc.
- [ ] Remove MapLibre box
- [ ] Display fun random messages (concept with avatars & random quotes, smth like maxis loading screens)
- [ ] Display amount of money gathered on map view too
