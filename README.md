How to use:

1. Define a map with waypoints using (Google Maps)[https://maps.google.com/]
2. Open left side menu -> Share or embed map -> Copy link
3. Paste this link to (Google Maps to GPX converter)[https://mapstogpx.com/]
4. Rename to 'route.gpx' and paste the file to `public/` folder (overwrite)

Boom, the map data should be updated!
